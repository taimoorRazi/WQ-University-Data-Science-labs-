# WQ-University-Data-Science-labs-

**This repository contains projects done by me in data science labs of WQ university. The projects shown here are not complete and do not contain dataset and are merely to show my learning and progress.

#	Project 1
In this project, you'll work with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico through the real estate website Properati.com. Your goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.
Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:
•	How to organize information using basic Python data structures.
•	How to import data from CSV files and clean it using the pandas library.
•	How to create data visualizations like scatter and box plots.
•	How to examine the relationship between two variables using correlation.

#	Project 2
In the last project, you learned data wrangling and visualization skills while examining the real estate market in Mexico. In this project, you'll build on those skills and move from descriptive to predictive data science. Your focus is still real estate, but now you need to create a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:

How to create a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.
How to build a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
How to improve model performance by reducing overfitting.
How to create a dynamic dashboard for interacting with your completed model.

# Project 3
In this project, you'll work with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica. You'll look at air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam; and build a time seriesmodel to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:

How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.
How to prepare time series data for analysis.
How to build an autoregression model.
How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.
Time series models are not only important in public health; they're a key part of Financial Engineering. Plus, concepts you learn in this project will be helpful in Natural Language Processing.

#	Project 4
In this project, you'll work with data from Open Data Nepal to build a model to predict building damage from the Nepal 2015 Earthquake. You'll work primarily with data from the Gorkha district, with additional examples from Ramechhap. _

Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:

How to get data by querying a SQL database.
How to build a logistic regression model for classification.
How to build a decision tree model for classification.
How to incorporate ethical considerations into your model building

#	Project 5
In this project, you'll explore data collected by a team of Polish economists studying bankruptcy. Your goal is to build a model that can predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not.

Once you complete these project, you'll be able to:

Navigate a file system from the Linux command line
Load and save files using Python
Address imbalanced data using resampling techniques
Evaluate a model using classification metrics like precision and recall

#	Project 6
In this project, you'll use data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances. First, you'll identify households that have a hard time getting credit. Then you'll build a model to segment these households into subgroups. Finally, you'll create an interactive web app to share your work.

This project is an example of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering. It can be used in commercial contexts for marketing or customer segmentation or in sociological contexts to study social stratification.

Once you complete this project, you'll be able to:

Compare characteristics across subgroups using a side-by-side bar chart.
Build a k-means clustering model.
Conduct feature selection for clustering based on variance.
Reduce high-dimensional data using principal component analysis (PCA).
Design, build and deploy a Dash web application.
